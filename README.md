# Prime Speed Controller

This extension was created because I got bored watching **The Rings of Power** ðŸ¥±ðŸ¥±ðŸ¥±. Now you can speed up those painfully slow scenes and watch at your own pace. Unlike other extensions, this one shows up right next to the other buttons in the video menu, so you can easily control the speed.
